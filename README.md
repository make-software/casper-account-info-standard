## Introduction

The Casper Account Info Standard provides a JSON schema and a mechanism for Casper Network accounts to
self identify and provide additional metadata for their owners, their other resources, services and policies.

## JSON Schema

The [JSON Schema](schema.json) provided in this project is compatible with
[JSON schema Draft 2019-09](https://json-schema.org/specification-links.html#2019-09-formerly-known-as-draft-8)
and can be validated with compatible schema validators and IDEs. 
The provided template [account-info.json](account-info.json) implements the schema and can be validated against 
it using online tools such as [JsonSchemaValidator.net](https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/s/ltMuxIEq).

### Schema Specification

        - **`longitude`** *(number)*: Longitude in decimal degrees
    - **`social`** *(object)*: Links to the Owner's social media profiles.
        - **`keybase`**: username only, e.g. 'john'.

## Usage as an Account Owner

### How does it work?

The Account Owner will cryptographically sign a deploy of a smart contract on the Casper Network, specifying that a specific domain name 
(e.g. https://example.com) is theirs. They will then place a JSON file in a specific location on that domain.
Once done, Block Explorers, dApps, and other clients on the Network can simply query the smart contract for the domain name 
by passing the Account's public key. This will allow them to retrieve the metadata file and display the detailed 
information that the Account Owner provided.
Examples to perform these queries will be provided in a separate repository.

### What do I do?

* create a file called `account-info.<chainspec-name>.json`, where `<chainspec-name>` represents the network the data file
  is intended for. For example, for Casper Mainnet, create: `account-info.casper.json` whereas for Casper Testnet, create
  `account-info.casper-test.json`. 
* Provide all required and desired details
* validate your resulting JSON against the `schema.json` file
* following [IETF RFC 8615](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8615) proposal for Well-Known URIs, place your
file in the following directory relative to the root of your domain name: `/.well-known/casper/`. In the Casper Mainnet example,
  your file would thus be available at `https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/casper/account-info.casper.json`
* Follow the instructions here [https://github.com/make-software/casper-account-info-contract/wiki](https://github.com/make-software/casper-account-info-contract/wiki) to link your Account to your domain name. Perform this step for every
one of your `affiliated_accounts` that you declare in your `account-info.json`.
